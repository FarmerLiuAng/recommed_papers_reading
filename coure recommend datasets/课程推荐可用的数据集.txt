1.MOOC_CUBE：http://moocdata.cn/data/MOOCCube
MOOCCube is an open data repository for natural language processing, knowledge graphs, data mining
and other researchers who are interested in massive open online courses(MOOCs). It contains 706 MOOC courses, 38,181 videos, 114,563 concepts, 
and 199,199 real MOOC users. This data source also contains a large-scale Concept Graph and related academic papers as additional resources for 
further utilization.
The information of our concept graph is extracted from Baidubaike, Wikipeida and Termonline. The data of courses and student activities are from
the real environment of XuetangX, one of the largest MOOC website in China. The academic resourses are provided by Aminer, an academic project 
which provides comprehensive search and mining services for researcher social networks. 

2.Course Concept Extraction:http://moocdata.cn/data/concept-extraction
This is the whole dataset of paper "Course Concept Extraction in MOOCs 
via Embedding-Based Graph Propagation" in IJCNLP 2017.
CSEN,CSZH,EcoEN,EcoZH are evaluation datasets mentioned in the paper. All data file are in standard json format. Each dataset contains two file:
Captions and Candidates.

3.Course Prerequisite Relation：-http://moocdata.cn/data/prerequisite-relation
 This is the dataset of paper "Prerequisite Relation Learning for Concepts in MOOCs" in ACL 2017.
DSA and ML are the dataset of different data of course category "Data structure and Algorithm" and "Machine Learning". Each dataset contains three kinds of file: Captions, Core_concepts and Labeled file.

4.Understanding Dropouts in MOOCs论文源码，包含数据集，可用于drop out预测：https://github.com/wzfhaha/dropout_prediction
This is the code for dropout prediction in our AAAI'19 paper:
Wenzheng Feng, Jie Tang, Tracy Xiao Liu, Shuhuai Zhang, Jian Guan. Understanding Dropouts in MOOCs. In Proceedings of the 33rd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI'19).

6.Open University Learning Analytics dataset:https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset
This page introduces the anonymised Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). It contains data about courses, students and their interactions with Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) for seven selected courses (called modules). Presentations of courses start in February and October - they are marked by “B” and “J” respectively. The dataset consists of tables connected using unique identifiers. All tables are stored in the csv format.
